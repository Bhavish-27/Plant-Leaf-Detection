# Plant-Leaf-Detection
In the plant leaf detection project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was employed to classify tomato plant leaves into three categories: "late blight," "healthy," and "early blight." Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model accurately identifies and categorizes leaf images based on characteristic features associated with each class. Through extensive training and validation, the project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in automated plant disease detection, offering a potential solution for early pest management and crop health monitoring in agriculture.
